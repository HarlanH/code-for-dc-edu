Code for DC Education Project
===============

This is the repository for the Code for DC Education Project.

The site is (for now at) http://harlanh.github.io/code-for-dc-edu/

To run locally on a unix-alike:

* Make sure you have Ruby installed.
* Run `gem install jekyll`.
* Run `jekyll build` in the repository -- this puts stuff in a `_site` subdirectory, which git will ignore.
* Run `jekyll serve --watch` to start a web server on `localhost:4000` and reload when you make changes.
